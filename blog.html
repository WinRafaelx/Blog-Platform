        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a few things I enjoyed about
        this film. The story is well crafted for most part, making effective use
        of foreshadowing. It’s certainly one of the most emotionally driven
        Doraemon movies, with several heartfelt moments among the characters,
        especially between Nobita and Doraemon and between Doraemon and the
        “perfect” robot cat Sonya. Speaking of which, Doraemon being the main
        protagonist to forge a connection with one of the movie characters is a
        rare occurrence! Additionally, Sonya himself probably qualifies as one
        of the more memorable and developed movie-exclusive characters in the
        franchise.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, there are ways in which the central
        theme of the story (essentially "it’s okay not to be perfect”) could
        have been handled with more nuance. After all, Gian and Suneo’s
        misbehavior is regularly shown to cause real harm to others throughout
        the franchise. I know, there are limits to how deeply one can explore a
        moral conundrum in a children’s film, but I don’t believe this would
        have been too challenging to achieve. Perhaps more emphasis could have
        been placed on learning to control one’s flaws and redirecting them into
        exacting positive change, contrasting with the villain’s plan to
        forcibly erase all individuality. Glimmers of this are already present
        in the aforementioned scene, but I think it could have been made more
        explicit still, which isn’t helped by the fact that the main villain
        only appears in person briefly and barely interacts with the heroes.

              It’s especially obvious comparing the remakes to brand-new
              stories, like the trio participate prominently in New Steel
              Troops, Great Demon, and Little Star Wars 2021, and those are all
              remakes of classic Doraemon movies. The only non-remake movie from
              the new era I can think of where they have a comparable presence
              might be Space Heroes.

              It really is my biggest disappointment with the film, especially
              given that more character exploration for the three would have fit
              nicely with the themes of the story. Instead we get another movie
              where nearly all of the spotlight is on Nobita and Doraemon, which
              works well for what it is, but I do sorely wish the new Doraemon
              movies would remember that the SSG trio are major characters, too!

              this a quick glance through! I don’t want to spoil myself too much
              but I had to satisfy my curiosity. Saddened that Shizuka, Suneo
              and Gian don’t get much focus but I can appreciate the other
              positives mentioned. I’m looking forward to whenever I can watch
              it for myself!
